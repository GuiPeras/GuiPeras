- 👋 Hi, I’m @GuiPeras,

- 👀 I’m interested in getting a job or internship as a web developer to gain more hands on experience in the field.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning React.js and in the very near future will start getting deep into Laravel PHP framework for backend.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that could get me more experience that I otherwise wouldn't get.

- 📫 How to reach me
